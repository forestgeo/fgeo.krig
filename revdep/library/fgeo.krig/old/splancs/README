R splancs package (Roger Bivand, Roger.Bivand@nhh.no):

This is a port to R of the splancs code described in Rowlingson, B. and 
Diggle, P. 1993 Splancs: spatial point pattern analysis code in S-Plus. 
Computers and Geosciences, 19, 627--655, (Barry Rowlingson 
<b.rowlingson@lancaster.ac.uk>); the original sources can be accessed at:
http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Splancs/

The port is partial, with examples added for most of the 2d spatial
functions, but not for 3d or raised incidence functions. Please let
me know if you have useful suggestions.

In 2.01-3/4 and later, Poisson Cluster Process by Giovanni Petris 
<GPetris@uark.edu> has been added, and inout() supplemented with an
alternative algoritm (about 4 times slower) for assigning points falling
on polygon boundaries either in or out rather than default arbitrary.

The original code also includes a uk() function and polygon data for a
UK county map. This is also omitted here, and should be re-introduced
to the map package, rather than this one.

The copyright situation is as follows: the original code has restrictions
regarding re-distribution, but these have been removed by Barry Rowlingson;
I have taken up the matter with Martin Maechler:

Martin Maechler (19 Sep 2000):

    Roger> but I'm not sure that that is enough for CRAN. 

I think it is.
I even think you can release it under the GNU public License,
*adding* to a Copyright for Barry Rowlingson (and yourself if you want).

Consequently, the following comment has been added to the component files:

------------------
Installing Splancs                                      BSR Dec '91
------------------

 Splancs takes the form of an S-Plus library. It might be useful to read
the section of the S manual on libraries before continuing.

 To correctly install Splancs it is neccessary that you are logged in
under an account that can write to the S-Plus directories. 


To install splancs, all that should be needed is to extract the files
from the tar archive (which you have probably done already if you are
reading this), edit the Makefile, and then run the shell script 
'Splancs.install'.

 1. Edit the makefile.

     It may be necessary to change the definition of F77 in the makefile
to point to your compiler. 

 2. Run the script 'Splancs.install'


 This shell script may take some time to do the installation of the S
functions. Be patient.

 If any part of the installation fails, try and correct the problem and
rerun the script.

 Possible danger areas are:

1. Compilation: the fortran code uses certain Sun Fortran extensions,
such as DO and END DO. Your compiler may not like this.

2. Dynamic loading: Since this code has only been tested on a
sparcstation, I cannot guarantee that the dynamic loading will work on
your machine. I found that some functions needed to be loaded with the
math library to find certain trig functions. The code for these
functions is loaded using mathlib.dynam, a modified library.dynam that
links with the libm.a. There may be problems with this on other
machines.

Solaris2 (Sunos 5) (and other machines) Problems:
-------------------------------------------------

 If you have problems with everything compiling with the Makefile, try
this approach:
 
 Join all the Fortran into one big Fortran file with:

 cat *.f >splancs.f

 Now compile this with the '-c' option:

 f77 -c splancs.f

 This should create a splancs.o file.

 Now create a file First.lib.s in the splancs library directory  with
 the following:
--------
 .First.lib <- function(library, section) {
# dynamically load file library/section/section_l.o
obj <- paste(library, "/", section, "/splancs.o", sep="")
dyn.load(obj)
cat("\nSpatial Point Pattern Analysis Code in S-Plus\n")
cat("\n Version 2.5 - Spatial and Space-Time analysis\n")
invisible(0)
}
--------

 Run Splus in this directory, and do 'source("First.lib.s")' to read it into
the .Data directory.

 Edit the following files and comment out any calls to mathlib.dynam or 
library.dynam

area.S   inout.S   k12hat.S  kernel2d.S  kernel3d.S
khat.S   khvc.S    khvmat.S  mse2d.S     n2dist.S
nndistF.S          nndistG.S stkhat.S    stvmat.S
tribble.S

 Run Splus in the library directory again and do 'source("Splancs.install.S")'
to read the modified functions.

 Now quit and run Splus from another directory. Try 'library(splancs)'. If this
produces errors with dyn.load then change First.lib.S to 'dyn.load2' and redo the
source command. Try again.

 When library(splancs) works, try the following:

Splus>  pts_spoints(runif(1000))
Splus>  pol_ sbox(pts)
Splus>  s_seq(0,.3,len=100)
Splus>  khat(pts,pol,s)

 If that produces an error then there's something else wrong. Contact me for
assistance!

ORIGINAL Splancs.NEW:

This release of Splancs includes the space-time clustering analysis
and the raised incidence modelling functions.

The polygon and kernel2d bugs have also been fixed.
