<h2>Pick the main stem or main stemid(s) of each tree in each census.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code><a href="pick_main_stem.html">pick_main_stem()</a></code> picks a unique row for each <code>treeID</code> per census.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code><a href="pick_main_stem.html">pick_main_stemid()</a></code> picks a unique row for each <code>stemID</code> per census. It is
only useful when a single stem was measured twice in the same census, which
sometimes happens to correct for the effect of large buttresses.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
pick_main_stem(data)

pick_main_stemid(data)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A ForestGEO-like dataframe: A <em>ViewFullTable</em>, <em>tree</em> or <em>stem</em>
table.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code><a href="pick_main_stem.html">pick_main_stem()</a></code> picks the main stem of each tree in each census. It
collapses data of multi-stem trees by picking a single stem per <code>treeid</code> per
<code>censusid</code>. From this group, it picks the stem at the top of a list sorted
first by descending order of <code>hom</code> and then by descending order of <code>dbh</code>.
This this corrects the effect of buttresses and picks the main stem. It
ignores groups of grouped data and rejects data with multiple plots.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code><a href="pick_main_stem.html">pick_main_stemid()</a></code> does one step less than <code><a href="pick_main_stem.html">pick_main_stem()</a></code>. It only
picks the main stemid(s) of each tree in each census and keeps all stems per
treeid. This is useful when calculating the total basal area of a tree,
because you need to sum the basal area of each individual stem as well as sum
only one of the potentially multiple measurements of each buttressed stem per
census.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe with a single plotname, and one row per per treeid per
censusid.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>These functions may be considerably slow. They are fastest if the data
already has a single stem per treeid. They are slower with data containing
multiple stems per <code>treeid</code> (per <code>censusid</code>), which is the main reason for
using this function. The slowest scenario is when data also contains
duplicated values of <code>stemid</code> per <code>treeid</code> (per <code>censusid</code>). This may
happen if trees have buttresses, in which case these functions check
every stem for potential duplicates and pick the one with the largest <code>hom</code>
value.
</p>
<p>For example, in a windows computer with 32 GB of RAM, a dataset with 2
million rows with multiple stems and buttresses took about 3 minutes to run.
And a dataset with 2 million rows made up entirely of main stems took about
ten seconds to run.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
# One `treeID` with multiple stems. 
# `stemID == 1.1` has two measurements (due to buttresses).
# `stemID == 1.2` has a single measurement.
census &lt;- tribble(
    ~sp, ~treeID, ~stemID,  ~hom, ~dbh, ~CensusID,
  "sp1",     "1",   "1.1",   140,   40,         1,  # main stemID (max `hom`)
  "sp1",     "1",   "1.1",   130,   60,         1,  
  "sp1",     "1",   "1.2",   130,   55,         1   # main stemID (only one)
)

# Picks a unique row per unique `treeID`
pick_main_stem(census)

# Picks a unique row per unique `stemID`
pick_main_stemid(census)
